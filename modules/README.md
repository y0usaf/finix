# Repository layout

This repository configures y0usaf's machines on finix: it owns system
integration and user configuration, not application implementations.
Headlong operations live in `~/dev/developing/headlong-ops`. A project that
stays external comes in as a flake input. Keep runners, application patches,
reusable skills and their tests with the module or project that owns them.
Runtime state and credentials stay outside the source tree and the Nix store.
Don't create root-level `nix/`, `tests/` or `previews/` directories.

`flake.nix` holds the inputs and hands them to `modules/outputs.nix`, which
builds every output with let bindings and plain functions. No module system
runs at flake level.

A host is a list of modules, and the `hosts` attrset in `modules/outputs.nix`
holds each host's list. Every host loads `modules/finix/common.nix`,
`diagnostics.nix` and `sudo.nix`: the settings all hosts share, boot
diagnostics and sudo. The graphical hosts load every `.nix` file under the
graphical roots (`core`, `desktop`, `dev`, `gaming`, `shell`, `tools`,
`user-services` and `hosts/common`), so each of those files is a module; the
server names its modules one by one: its role in `modules/server/`, its host
files and a few program modules.
`modules/hosts/common/` is the graphical role. Its system layer,
`modules/finix/desktop/`, is imported from `graphical.nix` instead of loaded
as a root. Roots load in path order, and a list option merges in load order,
so moving a module moves its packages, kernel modules and udev rules within
those lists and changes the build.

Loading a module turns it on. A module declares an option only when the hosts
that load it need different values, or when three or more modules read the
value. Anything else is written where it is used, and a helper one module
uses is a let binding in that module.

A program's module owns its packages, settings, dotfiles and persisted paths,
and decides from hardware facts such as `hardware.nvidia.enable`, never from
the hostname. A program that needs only its package is a line in its
category's package list: `core/packages.nix`, `desktop/packages.nix`,
`dev/packages.nix`, `tools/packages.nix`, `gaming/core.nix` or
`server/packages.nix`. `tools/tmux.nix` stays a module of its own because the
server loads it by name. Persisted paths no module owns go in
`modules/hosts/common/persist.nix` when both graphical hosts keep them, and in
the host's `config.nix` when only that host does.

Each host directory under `modules/hosts/` holds what is true of that machine
alone, in two files beside its keys and other non-Nix files.
`hardware-config.nix` holds facts about the machine: disks, btrfs subvolumes
and mount options, boot, kernel and initrd modules, firmware, GPU and
displays. `config.nix` holds the host's choices: hostname, open ports,
host-only persisted paths, services, and where it departs from its role.
`modules/hosts/shared.nix` holds the machinery the hosts share, a btrfs mount
builder and the nftables ruleset, which each host calls with its own values;
hosts import it, and no host list loads it. `modules/hosts/android-phone/` is
the nix-on-droid phone.

`modules/hosts/steam-frame/` is the Steam Frame, which runs NixOS, not finix.
Its system is the external steam-frame-nixos project. It is not a flake input:
its build reads gitignored Valve files that only a `path:` ref of the live
checkout sees, and a locked `path:` input would fail every evaluation of this
flake whenever that checkout changed. `config.nix` is the personal layer, a
NixOS module that reuses `tools/git.nix` and `tools/tmux.nix` and links files
with manzil; `bolo.nix` runs bolo on the CPU and fetches its speech model at
boot into the big home partition, out of the small root; `mado.nix` runs
mado-view whenever SteamVR runs, so the headset shows the PC's mado stream.
`deploy.nix` builds `finix-frame-deploy`, which extends the checkout's
`nixosConfigurations.frame` with manzil's NixOS module, that layer, manzil's
static aarch64 linker (cross-built on this machine) and bolo's and mado's
aarch64 packages (`--impure`), then copies and switches the Frame over ssh.
The rest of the closure builds under the qemu aarch64 binfmt handler;
`finix-frame-deploy` names the command that registers it when it is missing.

`modules/finix/sudo.nix` configures sudo itself and takes only the privileges
provider from finix's sudo module. Leave `programs.sudo.enable` off: it also
installs the non-setuid sudo binary, which shadowed the
`/run/wrappers/bin/sudo` wrapper on PATH (c9a60e8c).

A directory holds a category or one module's assets. No file exists only to
import others or to set values another module owns, except
`modules/finix/desktop/default.nix`, whose import keeps the graphical role's
system layer at its place in that merge order.

Validate with `nix build --no-link`, so no result link lands in the repo.
